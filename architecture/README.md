# Borinot architecture

Borinot consists of hardware and software, both within the robot body and outside as necessary support elements.

This chapter describes the architecture.

## Hardware

The Borinot robot consists of a flying platform and an arm, and is supported by some external equipments such as the WIFI router, Optitrack and the base station or Laptop.

## Software

Borinot runs many pieces of software. Here, we detail the information flow for estimation (from sensors to computer) and control (from computer to motors). We also show the data flow for simulations.
